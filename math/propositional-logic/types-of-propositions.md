# Types of Propositions
A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
1. Tautology: A proposition that is **always** true, no matter what the truth
   values of its components are, e.g. $p \lor \lnot p$.
2. Contradiction: A proposition that is **always** false, no matter what the
   value of its inputs are, e.g. $p \land \lnot p$.
3. Contingency: A proposition that can sometimes be true and sometimes be false,
   depending on the value of its components, e.g. $p \lor q$.
